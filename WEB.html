                <p>Hi!  I'm Muhammad Mubashir, I'm a senior Web developer with extensive experience in building high-quality sites. I have a lot of experience in mobile UI / UX Design, Graphics Designer, WordPress, large web portals and services, which in my opinion, should have the strongest and highest quality functionality and design. I'm developed specific frameworks/tools/modules for other teams of developers to React and just on JavaScript, mobile and web projects for the best customers on the big exchanges of the world!</p>
                <p>Web developer skills refer to the specific abilities needed to get hired and successfully perform in a web developer role. Having these skills in abundance can help you stand out from other candidates vying for the same role and in your everyday tasks on the job. As with any job, you also can develop your skills as a web developer over time. Some web developer skills include understanding HTML, general design skills and being analytical. <br>If you hope to become a web developer, you must understand HTML and CSS. HTML is the most used markup language across the web, and web developers use it to create web pages on the Internet. CSS, on the other hand, is used to style the website. It's responsible for the choice of fonts, colors and layout in a website's design. Whereas HTML lays the foundation for a webpage, CSS styles it.</p>
